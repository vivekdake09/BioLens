## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP development
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability and validation
- Property-based tests validate universal correctness properties across many inputs
- Unit tests validate specific examples, edge cases, and integration points
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation and provide opportunities for user feedback
- The implementation prioritizes core functionality first, then adds comprehensive testing and advanced features
